# SURFsara-Beamer

This beamer template works with both ```lualatex``` and ```xelatex```.

## Supported Options ##
The SURFsara these supports the following options:
beamer

1. location
2. logo

### location
This option is used on the opening page of the presentation and gives the
opportunity to specify an optional location, i.e. where the presentation is
given.

### logo
The SURFsara theme uses the graphics/logos/SURF_SARA_fc.pdf logo by default.
In case you wish to use a different logo, use this option to specify its
location.
